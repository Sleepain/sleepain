# Information we collect

We store and process any data you input into the application through the daily in-app surveys that we send to you. In addition, we collect your mobile device id as a unique identifier. We do not collect any other sensitive data besides your device id. The collection of the device id allows us to uniquely identify you and your data from other users and using this information, we are able to track your progress of responses throughout the duration of the study. This will allow us to provide targeted responses and also enable us to show or remove your data at any time should you request us to do so. If however, we do collect any additional data in the future, the reasons why you are asked to provide it will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.

If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.


# How we use your information
